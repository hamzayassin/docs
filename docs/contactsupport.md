## Troubleshooting your problem

Your server won't start? Or you are having problems which you cannot solve alone? No problem! Our support team is here for you. 

However, before contacting our support team, we strongly recommend attempting few troubleshooting steps which may resolve or narrow down the problem.

:::note
Please keep in mind that we do not offer direct account-related support on our socials, only through our discord. This is because we value privacy and thus we only provide official support through our own discord.

### Check your server's status
You can easily find the current status of all of our services, including your server by heading over to our [Status Page](https://status.fsho.st/) and viewing the appropriate service.

:::tip
On our status site, you can even subscribe via email to notificaitons for any service on our network! You can do this, by pressing the arrow button on the top right, selecting the scope and entering the email you would like notifications to be sent to.

If the product that you are having problems with is currently affected, we advise you to wait until this has been resolved. Our technicians are automatically alerted about any interruptions and will be working on solving the problem as soon as possible.

## Creating a new ticket

If you are still in need of support, please create a ticket on our Discord server.
