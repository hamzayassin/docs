  <summary>How do I add plugins/mods/bots?</summary>

We don't offer uploading files on our free or Pro servers. If you want us to add something that we don't already provide, please let us know, and we'll take a look.

  <summary>What does "free" include?</summary>

We offer temporary servers that go offline after they're empty. These come with access to RCON so you can change any setting supported by the game. Each server you create will get a random port but if you pick the same region (server), the IP will mostly stay the same.
\
\
We're working to get more features added but we can't always add them to our free offering. We do have to pay to run this site!

<details>
  <summary>Can I change server settings?</summary>

You can set some initial settings when you start your server, any others need to be done via RCON/Admin login. If you want to find out more about RCON commands for games we support, head over to the help section for Gameserver.

<details>
  <summary>Can I create public servers?</summary>

Yes, you can leave the join password empty so anyone can join. Remember, once your free server goes offline, you'll lose any settings and also you will get a new port the next time you create one.
\
\
This applies to free servers only.
