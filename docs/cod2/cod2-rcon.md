## General Settings
**Map**<br />
You can change the current map to any stock one or we have a custom map list.

After changing any map settings, like the game mode, it is required to restart the map so it can change.
<br /> `/rcon map_restart`

Reset the scores and map.
<br /> `/rcon fast_restart`

**Password** <br />You can change or remove the password to join your server by leaving the value empty.
<br /> `/rcon g_password ""`

**Hostname** <br />You can change the hostname on the request form or if you want to change it after you've started it, you can do so using this command. **Please note that you are required to keep the advert part in the hostname.**
`/rcon sv_hostname "^6CUSTOM HOSTNAME ^7- free @ fshost.me"`

**Game Mode** <br />
Changing the game mode is easy with this command but remember to restart the map after setting the game mode.
